## ...this blog, in general?

My bookmark archive of various links (ranging from ''huh, that's interesting, I'll read that later'' to ''this is a great reference'' and even ''AMAZING!!'') has grown so large it's practically unmanageable.

As a solution, from this point on I intend to collect all those newspaper articles, arxiv preprint pdfs, and real blog posts here, and make heavy use of Jekyll's tag and category mechanism to make this catalogue an *actually useful resource* to me, instead of the current kitchen sink of a Firefox bookmark folder.
Lightweight, static, markdown-and-YAML-metadata-block based blog platform seems good enough tool for this purpose, as a side-product I have now myself a new blog, and I see no reason why it couldn't live in the public web.

In other words, this 'blog' will (hopefully) a mainly link-blog (if such things exist anymore in the age of Twitter?),
*maybe* with an occasional longer post.

I try to stick to English, but that's not a promise, and you might see Finnish now and then.

## ...technical details?

This is a simple static blog built with
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
(Static webpages == awesome; fast *and* simple!
However, don't expect I'm going to implement comments too soon.)

The theme you see is based on the default Jekyll theme
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /
[jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new) with some modifications.
