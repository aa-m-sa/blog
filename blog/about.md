## ...this blog, in general?

I suppose I'll write your ordinary "what this blog is about" bit here later
(...I need to figure that out myself *first*).

## ...technical details?

This is a simple static blog built with
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
(Static webpages == awesome; fast *and* simple!
However, don't expect I'm going to implement comments too soon.)

The theme you see is based on the default Jekyll theme:
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /
[jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)
