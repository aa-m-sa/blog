This is a list of some of the blogs I read. (Like all such lists, it's incomplete and outdated.)
I occasionally even write short introductions, which can be found under the blogroll category on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/all_categories/" class="category-link">all categories page</a>

## Blogs

*in no particular order*

[The Renaissance Mathematicus](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/): history and philosophy of science. Learn why Copernician crisis wasn't, and much more. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}/blogroll-renaissance.html).

Sir Timothy [Gowers' weblog](https://gowers.wordpress.com/), of [Discrete Analysis](http://discreteanalysisjournal.com/) fame. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}/blogroll-gowers.html).

Scott Aaronson blogs at [Shtetl-Optimized](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/). Quantum computing and complexity theory and tangential subjects.

Bill Gasarch and Lanse Fortnow blog at [Computational Complexity](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/) about guess what. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}/blogroll-computational-complexity.html). (... why I read so many complexity theory blogs if I'm not even specializing in complexity theory? One needs hobbies?).

Zach C. Lipton at [Approximately Correct](http://approximatelycorrect.com/) on AI, ML and others. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}link-zachary-lipton-ai-misinformation.html).

R. J. Lipton at [Gödel's Lost Letter](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/). Complexity theory, P vs NP, other similar CS topics. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}/blogroll-godels-lost-letter.html).

[With high probability](https://samidavies.wordpress.com/).  Combinatorics, probability, and theoretical computer science. [Earlier post]({{site.baseurl}}/blogroll-with-high-probability.html).

[Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/). Usually I know that the current topic of the posts is way over my head, but the old [articles](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/a-cheap-version-of-nonstandard-analysis/) and [lecture notes](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/teaching/245a-real-analysis/) are a treasure to any working mathematician.

Andrew Gelman has a very active blog: [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/). Also occasional contributions by [Bob Carpenter, Aki Vehtari, and others](http://andrewgelman.com/authors/).

[John K. Kruschke](https://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com) (author of [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis aka the Dogs Book](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/)) blogs about Bayesian statistics.

[Simo K. Kivelä](http://simokivela.blogspot.fi) blogs about (numerical) maths in Finnish.

Mike Glyer updates about science fiction news at [File770](http://file770.com). Very prolific.

[Jukka Kemppinen](http://kemppinen.blogspot.fi). Half of the time I don't have any idea what he writes about, but more often than not, it's interesting. Maybe one broad thematic descriptor would be ''cultural history of Finland''? (In Finnish.)

[SlateStarCodex](http://slatestarcodex.com/about/). The weird one.
